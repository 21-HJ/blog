abstract = {Background: Regression analysis is an important statistical method for the analysis of medical data. It enables the identification and characterization of relationships among multiple factors. It also enables the identification of prognostically relevant risk factors and the calculation of risk scores for individual prognostication. Methods: This article is based on selected textbooks of statistics, a selective review of the literature, and our own experience.Results: After a brief introduction of the uni- and multivariable regression models, illustrative examples are given to explain what the important considerations are before a regression analysis is performed, and how the results should be interpreted. The reader should then be able to judge whether the method has been used correctly and interpret the results appropriately.Conclusion: The performance and interpretation of linear regression analysis are subject to a variety of pitfalls, which are discussed here in detail. The reader is made aware of common errors of interpretation through practical examples. Both the opportunities for applying linear regression analysis and its limitations are presented.},

abstract="Starting from first principles and general assumptions we present a heuristic argument that shows that Newton's law of gravitation naturally arises in a theory in which space emerges through a holographic scenario. Gravity is identified with an entropic force caused by changes in the information associated with the positions of material bodies. A relativistic generalization of the presented arguments directly leads to the Einstein equations. When space is emergent even Newton's law of inertia needs to be explained. The equivalence principle auggests that it is actually the law of inertia whose origin is entropic.",

abstract="We study briefly some properties of real Clifford algebras and identify them as matrix algebras. We then show that the representation space on which Clifford algebras act are spinors and we study in details matrix representations. The precise structure of these matrices gives rise to the type of spinors one is able to construct in a given space-time dimension: Majorana or Weyl. Properties of spinors are also studied. We finally show how Clifford algebras enable us to construct supersymmetric extensions of the Poincar{\'e} algebra. A special attention to the four, ten and eleven-dimensional space-times is given. We then study the representations of the considered supersymmetric algebras and show that representation spaces contain an equal number of bosons and fermions. Supersymmetry turns out to be a symmetry which mixes non-trivially the bosons and the fermions since one multiplet contains bosons and fermions together. We also show how supersymmetry in four and ten dimensions are related to eleven dimensional supersymmetry by compactification or dimensional reduction.",

 abstract = {We study linear smoothers and their use in building nonparametric regression models. In the first part of this paper we examine certain aspects of linear smoothers for scatterplots; examples of these are the running-mean and running-line, kernel and cubic spline smoothers. The eigenvalue and singular value decompositions of the corresponding smoother matrix are used to describe qualitatively a smoother, and several other topics such as the number of degrees of freedom of a smoother are discussed. In the second part of the paper we describe how linear smoothers can be used to estimate the additive model, a powerful nonparametric regression model, using the "back-fitting algorithm." We show that backfitting is the Gauss-Seidel iterative method for solving a set of normal equations associated with the additive model. We provide conditions for consistency and nondegeneracy and prove convergence for the backfitting and related algorithms for a class of smoothers that includes cubic spline smoothers.},

 URL = {http://www.jstor.org/stable/24306972},
 abstract = {The generalized estimating equation (GEE) approach is becoming more and more popular in handling correlated response data, for example in longitudinal studies. An attractive property of the GEE is that one can use some working correlation structure that may be wrong, but the resulting regression coefficient estimate is still consistent and asymptotically normal. One convenient choice is the independence model: treat the correlated responses as if they were independent. However with time-varying covariates there is a dilemma: using the independence model may be very inefficient (Fitzmaurice (1995)); using a non-diagonal working correlation matrix may violate an important assumption in GEE, producing biased estimates (Pepe and Anderson (1994)). It would be desirable to be able to distinguish these two situations based on the data at hand. More generally, selecting an appropriate working correlation structure, as an aspect of model selection, may improve estimation efficiency. In this paper we propose some resampling-based methods (i.e., the bootstrap and cross-validation) to do this. The methodology is demonstrated by application to the Lung Health Study (LHS) data to investigate the effects of smoking cessation on lung function and on the symptom of chronic cough. In addition, Pepe and Anderson's result is verified using the LHS data.},

abstract="This paper addresses the solution of bound-constrained optimization problems using algorithms that require only the availability of objective function values but no derivative information. We refer to these algorithms as derivative-free algorithms. Fueled by a growing number of applications in science and engineering, the development of derivative-free optimization algorithms has long been studied, and it has found renewed interest in recent time. Along with many derivative-free algorithms, many software implementations have also appeared. The paper presents a review of derivative-free algorithms, followed by a systematic comparison of 22 related implementations using a test set of 502 problems. The test bed includes convex and nonconvex problems, smooth as well as nonsmooth problems. The algorithms were tested under the same conditions and ranked under several criteria, including their ability to find near-global solutions for nonconvex problems, improve a given starting point, and refine a near-optimal solution. A total of 112,448 problem instances were solved. We find that the ability of all these solvers to obtain good solutions diminishes with increasing problem size. For the problems used in this study, TOMLAB/MULTIMIN, TOMLAB/GLCCLUSTER, MCS and TOMLAB/LGO are better, on average, than other derivative-free solvers in terms of solution quality within 2,500 function evaluations. These global solvers outperform local solvers even for convex problems. Finally, TOMLAB/OQNLP, NEWUOA, and TOMLAB/MULTIMIN show superior performance in terms of refining a near-optimal solution.",
